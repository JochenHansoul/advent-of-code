Possible functional solution.
You furst create a bag class that can only receive a color, pattern and
bag content that is a map with the bags and their amount.
First when loading the text file we create a filterer array consisting of
string with at first the original color and pattern of the bag and then
the childbags and their amounts (amount in strings).
We order this array on lengt from the most few bag to the most bags
(possibly working with TreeSet?)
We then take the bags that contain no bags and ad them to a newly created
bagRules set. We then iterate trough the array or TreeSet and search for
the bags that only contain bags that are in the set and create new bags
out of those bags with a set of the bags that are withim then and continue
untill the set contains as much bags as the length of the array or TreeSet.
