/*
--- Part Two ---

As you finish the last group's customs declaration, you notice that you misread one word in the instructions:
You don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered "yes"; you need to identify the questions to which
everyone answered "yes"!

Using the same example as above:
abc

a
b
c

ab
ac

a
a
a
a

b

This list represents answers from five groups:
    In the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
    In the second group, there is no question to which everyone answered "yes".
    In the third group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a. Since some people did not answer "yes" to b or c,
    they don't count.
    In the fourth group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a.
    In the fifth group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 1 question, b.

In this example, the sum of these counts is 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.
For each group, count the number of questions to which everyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?


mogelijke oplossing:
maak een array van 26 integers
voor elk antwoord in een groep verhoog de overkomstige waarde in de array met 1
if c1 == c2 {
    alphabet[c1 - a]++;
}
vergelijk waarden array met aantal groep antwoorden. als gelijk verhoog sumAllAnswers met 1
reset alfabet array
